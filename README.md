# 👋 Hi there, I'm Adam

Just a guy who likes coffee ☕ crafting simple software solutions to complex real-world 🌎 problems. Code for the people.

Not an IT prodigy, not even a PC until adulthood, not that it matters, suffering, & independently recovering & rehabilitating   
from years of multiple severe injuries, including total loss of not just memory but all skills & senses, including motor to  
complement paralyses, etc. Not even in the sociotechnical emergence of AI, nor a PC today, nor ever for long with ongoing  
24/7 epic plagues of random wrongdoing insanity continuing to harass my every breath eternal, global. Too much to remember,  
spanning longer than average human memory, anyway - extreme machinations since early childhood to be precise.

# Fun facts

Frankly, should be not fun facts, but here goes:

<!-- A couple decades ago, EM was sleeping on an office floor, or was it a futon? A couple decades ago I was purchasing a kebab/souvlaki & eating it too when noticing EM awkwardly gawking at me from behind a computer game shop counter next to food court, back to customers (if any that eon); like backward window shopping the real world. How do I know? - the randomness, posture, intensity, & eccentric promoting & elaborating of Paypal as a viable investment solution. A couple decades ago I was also sleeping on a futon on a sloped garage floor, or sauna, but was a real kid. -->

Basically, I completed enough credits for two master's degrees before graduating with any bachelor's, which is only not two itself if not for delays to leave just as I entered; double requirements for less than half rights under the most adverse of circumstances. As if that wasn't insane enough, I had to spend longer than it takes someone as me - or everyone else today - to complete a double degree single-handedly "challenging" not just that but all already ignored historic context (including all conflicting & (self-)contradicting compulsive never-ending pretense) in retrospect with an already double workload without any supporting degree (or memory, or anything ever) to end just as begun; not really there (cyber even), & a formal declaration of them not doing anything (but blatantly laugh with my money & rights) & "just as I want"?! Coincides with only just rehabilitating & restoring to equilibrium from all historic harm & damages, but who isn't ever in this but me to make sense always! At least I did it all independently, honestly, & peacefully without a trail of destruction, if that makes sense for others. Could just be one the greatest true crime cases at least locally. Tell that to a judge. View my studies [here](https://university-project-repos.github.io/.github/).
