# Fun facts

Basically, retrospectively, I completed enough credits for two master's degrees before graduating with any bachelor's, which is only not two itself if not for ineffably abysmal, illogically farcically (historically) unrepentently inexorably 1984-like rapaciously unstable grandiose deluded mojo autocrapit creepshow extortive, inherently catch-22, consistently self-refuting, absolute sisyphean - impossibly "meticulously" - inverted charade delays (bear with me until I find the magic word(s) - almost more effort than the degree itself, single-handedly, in parallel with an already double workload under consistent conspirative undermining & sabotage, etc) to leave just as I entered: double requirements for less than half rights under the most adverse of chronically misrepresented circumstances on repeat to say the utmost least. It's so epically pointlessly wastefully self-important omnipotent, it can be likened to Troy in a sense, & all furthermore impact since can be likened to a backwater global Odyssey, literally. As if independently fully recovering & rehabilitating (&, of course, suffering, when get the time to feel) from years of multiple consecutive severe injuries, including total loss of not just memory but all skills & senses, including motor to complement paralyses, & hand-eye coordination, if not eye (sight) loss almost outright (including projectiled out/in, etc) multiple times, each subsequent to prior recovery - & never from anything possibly seeable let alone forseeable (depending how you look at things, & seeing is believing after all, but that's all in the eye of the beholder) - including recently with multiple concurrent dibilitating varying infections literally from head-to-toe & anywhere in-between coincidentally affected by prior injuries (in parallel with desperado device destruction, which is also reoccuring in itself), etc. (kind of like Bourne but real problems, easier than it looks), while honestly & aptitudinally completing these studies (ironically including all possibly & contrastingly inconsequentially relevant, stable, & remarkably valid pre-pandemic & hence pre-GenAI credits or advanced equivalences from studies abroad with participation in formal exchanges, & much more, & this is not to mention true, empathetic individual contributions - all in the hands of those blatantly elusively rabid attacking me &/with my rights & many more, whether handed or not, that group/course/year/planet or not, etc., just like where they come from, & leave again, just like a Ponzi scheme, just like a war machine (just like a little girl with candy from all I could see) - of perfectly blind blame - perfect city/land for it it seems for now), combined with ongoing, literally 24/7 (extremely inhospitably violently torturously uninhabitable, with permanently induced sleep deprivation - & life scars, obsessions & sentences - to prove), epic plagues of random (cyber, hate) wrongdoing insanity collectively continuing to harass my every breath eternal, global at all compulsive expense & (emotional, financial) harm on me with anything but support (& everything consistently stolen from/eradicated, including digitally (since long before I ever owned a computer, & the circumstances of the delays alone are a significant example of such fraud; as it turns out I was "never really there", ever, at least in their grand socio-technical scheme of things, not that they ever paid attention, not unless it involves my violated personal/private data or selectively excluding my academic history from known existence, & including all underlying undermining & sabotage, etc.), but not dignity, although identity since very early childhood (if not life altogether, & even including int sport, multiple season winning goals & awards, ironically each first season ever with significantly inhibiting deep foreign body (also nitpick scapegoat punk-drilled half to death over for royalty, & it's likely no coincidence the Cpl/Sgts are compulsive crim/gangsters, ensuring only I miss out on a rifle badge at 13 regardless of only following given orders (while humbly understanding & tolerating my whole life), & successfully, or that all this type are randomly also at uni then somehow, as if amnesia is Alzheimer's), & almost also new back injury, & almost sg blast, but when isn't, for eg.), not unless taking is giving) isn't sadistically random kafkaesque enough, & then there's also the aforementioned adverse circumstances as well, but then that's supposedly everyone else's story (like GoT?, for eg, but who's Reek if not me then? & if ever a trial could only, "in all probability" possibly be won by combat, & with a duel already challenged & declined at the same time rendering me the unwitting instant winner it seems naturally determined long already - how convenient for me when it's all about who over what), or everyone else's!? Does that then make them (Oxford-material, as all they see) pretentious (by Oxford-worthy random pretense) or (somehow self-pretextually!?) invalid instead?
