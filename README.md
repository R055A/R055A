# 👋 Hi there, I'm Adam

Just a guy who likes to drink coffee ☕ crafting simple software solutions to complex real-world 🌎 problems.

Not an IT prodigy, not even a PC until adulthood, not that it matters, suffering, & independently recovering & 
rehabilitating from years of multiple severe injuries, including total loss of not just memory but all skills & senses, 
including motor to complement paralyses, etc. Not even in the sociotechnical emergence of AI, nor a PC today, nor ever for long
with ongoing 24/7 epic plagues of random wrongdoing insanity continuing to harass my every breath eternal, global. 
Too much to remember, spanning longer than average human memory, anyway - extreme machinations since early childhood to be precise.
