# Fun facts

Basically, retrospectively, I completed enough credits for two master's degrees before graduating with any bachelor's, which is only not two itself if not for ineffably abysmal, illogically farcically unrepentently inexorably 1984-like rapaciously unstable grandiose mojo autocrapit creepshow extortive, inherently catch-22, consistently self-refuting grandoise delusions, absolute sisyphean charade delays (bear with me until I find the magic word(s) - almost more effort than the degree itself, single-handedly, in parallel with an already double workload) to leave just as I entered: double requirements for less than half rights under the most adverse of chronically misrepresented circumstances on repeat to say the utmost least. As if independently fully recovering & rehabilitating (&, of course, suffering, when get the time to feel) from years of multiple consecutive severe injuries, including total loss of not just memory but all skills & senses, including motor to complement paralyses, & hand-eye coordination, if not eye (sight) loss outright almost multiple times, each subsequent to prior recovery - & never from anything possibly seeable let alone forseeable - including recently with multiple concurrent dibilitating varying infections literally from head-to-toe & anywhere in-between coincidentally affected by prior injuries (in parallel with desperado device destruction, which is also reoccuring in itself), etc. (kind of like Bourne but real problems), while honestly & aptitudinally completing these studies (ironically including all possibly & contrastingly inconsequentially relevant, stable, & remarkably valid pre-pandemic & hence pre-GenAI credits or advanced equivalences from studies abroad with participation in formal exchanges, & much more, & this is not to mention true, empathetic individual contributions - all in the hands of those blatantly rabid attacking me & many more, whether handed or not, that group/course/year or not, etc., just like where they come from, & leave again, just like a Ponzi scheme, just like a war machine - of perfectly blind blame - perfect city/land for it it seems for now), combined with ongoing, literally 24/7 (with permanently induced sleep deprivation - & life scars & sentences - to prove), epic plagues of random (cyber, hate) wrongdoing insanity collectively continuing to harass my every breath eternal, global at all compulsive expense & (emotional, financial) harm on me with anything but support (& everything consistently stolen from, including digitally (the circumstances of the delays alone are a significant example of such fraud), but not dignity, although identity since early childhood (even including int sport & awards, first season with significantly inhibiting deep foreign body, & almost also new back injury, & ironically why, for eg.), not unless taking is giving) isn't sadistically random kafkaesque enough, & then there's also the aforementioned adverse circumstances as well, but then that's everyone's story (like GoT?, for eg, but who's Reek? & if ever a trial could only, "in all probability" possibly be won by combat, & with a duel already challenged & declined at the same time rendering me the unwitting winner by instant default it seems naturally determined already), or everyone else's!? Does that then make them pretentious (by random pretense) or (somehow self-pretextually!?) invalid instead? View my studies [here](https://university-project-repos.github.io/.github/).
