# Fun facts

Basically, I completed enough credits for two master's degrees before graduating with any bachelor's, which is only not two itself if not for ineffably abysmal, illogically inexorably farcically 1984-like rapaciously extortive, inherently catch-22, consistently self-refuting, absolute sisyphean charade delays (bear with me until I find the magic word(s) - almost more effort than the degree itself, single-handedly, in parallel with an already double workload) to leave just as I entered; double requirements for less than half rights under the most adverse of chronically misrepresented circumstances on repeat to say the utmost least. As if independently fully recovering & rehabilitating (&, of course, suffering) from years of multiple consecutive severe injuries, including total loss of not just memory but all skills & senses, including motor to complement paralyses, etc. (kind of like Bourne but real problems), while honestly & aptitudinally completing these studies (ironically including all possibly & contrastingly inconsequentially relevant, stable, & valid pre-pandemic & hence pre-GenAI credits or advanced equivalences from studies abroad with participation in formal exchanges, & much more, & this is not to mention true, empathetic individual contributions), combined with ongoing, literally 24/7 (with permanently induced sleep deprivation - & life scars & sentences - to prove), epic plagues of random (cyber) wrongdoing insanity collectively continuing to harass my every breath eternal, global at all compulsive expense & harm on me with anything but support (& everything consistently stolen from, including digitally (the circumstances of the delays alone are a significant example of such fraud), but not dignity, although identity since early childhood (even including int sport & awards, first season with significantly inhibiting deep foreign body injury, & ironically why, for eg.), not unless taking is giving) isn't sadistically kafkaesque enough, & then there's also the aforementioned adverse circumstances as well, but then that's everyone's story, or everyone else's (like GoT!?, for eg).
