# GitHub Profile Repository Pins

Personalize selection, visualization and dynamic ordering of repository pins for public and private GitHub profiles.  
No PAT required, just copy the repo using the template feature for efficient data fetching and visualization rendering.
Supports profile website deployment for full utilization of the frequently updated repository pin visualization features.

## Instructions

* Simply create a copy of this template repository by clicking [here](https://github.com/new?template_name=readme-repo-pins&template_owner=r055a)
  * name the new repository `Repository name*` identical to the `owner*` name.
  * select the green `Create Repository` button.

This creates a GitHub profile with frequently updated repo pins using CI automation and a placeholder:

`<!-- START/END: REPO-PINS -->`

The text in this repository is removed so that profiles only display the generated repository pins and other content
added outside the placeholder. There is no further setup requirement for the profile repository and its automation.
<!-- END: REPO-PINS -->
