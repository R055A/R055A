👋 Hi there. Just a guy who likes coffee ☕ crafting simple software solutions to complex real-world 🌎 problems. Code for the people.

# Fun facts

Basically, I completed enough credits for two master's degrees before graduating with any bachelor's, which is only not two itself if not for ineffably abysmal, illogically inexorably half-baked 1984-like extortive, inherently catch-22, absolute sisyphean delays (almost more effort than the degree itself, single-handedly, already with a double workload) to leave just as I entered; double requirements for less than half rights under the most adverse of chronically misrepresented circumstances to say the utmost least. As if independently recovering & rehabilitating (&, of course, suffering) from years of multiple consecutive severe injuries, including total loss of not just memory but all skills & senses, including motor to complement paralyses, etc. (kind of like Bourne but real problems), while honestly & aptitudinally completing these studies (ironically including all possibly & contrastingly inconsequentially relevant, pre-pandemic & hence pre-GenAI credits or advanced equivalences from studies abroad with participation in formal exchanges, & much more, & this is not to mention true, empathetic individual contributions), combined with ongoing 24/7 epic plagues of random wrongdoing insanity collectively continuing to harass my every breath eternal, global at all compulsive expense on me with anything but support (& everything consistently stolen from, including digitally, but not dignity, although identity since early childhood, not unless taking is giving) isn't sadistically kafkaesque enough.
