# Fun facts

Basically, retrospectively, I completed enough credits for two master's degrees before graduating with any bachelor's, which is only not two itself if not for ineffably abysmal, illogically farcically (historically) unrepentently inexorably 1984-like rapaciously unstable grandiose deluded mojo autocrapit creepshow extortive, inherently catch-22, consistently self-refuting, absolute sisyphean inverted charade delays (bear with me until I find the magic word(s) - almost more effort than the degree itself, single-handedly, in parallel with an already double workload) to leave just as I entered: double requirements for less than half rights under the most adverse of chronically misrepresented circumstances on repeat to say the utmost least. It's so epically pointlessly wastefully self-omnipotent, it can be likened to Troy in a sense (that is, if Helen is the likes of gamified accreditation, unless prioritizing tanning on a beach for years is not backward), & all furthermore impact since can be likened to a backwater Odyssey, literally - & would say realest water but it seems to be pollutedest in my absence. As if independently fully recovering & rehabilitating (&, of course, suffering, when get the time to feel) from years of multiple consecutive severe injuries, including total loss of not just memory but all skills & senses, including motor to complement paralyses, & hand-eye coordination, if not eye (sight) loss almost outright (including projectiled out/in, etc) multiple times, each subsequent to prior recovery - & never from anything possibly seeable let alone forseeable (depending how you look at things, & seeing is believing after all, but it's all in the eye of the beholder) - including recently with multiple concurrent dibilitating varying infections literally from head-to-toe & anywhere in-between coincidentally affected by prior injuries (in parallel with desperado device destruction, which is also reoccuring in itself), etc. (kind of like Bourne but real problems), while honestly & aptitudinally completing these studies (ironically including all possibly & contrastingly inconsequentially relevant, stable, & remarkably valid pre-pandemic & hence pre-GenAI credits or advanced equivalences from studies abroad with participation in formal exchanges, & much more, & this is not to mention true, empathetic individual contributions - all in the hands of those blatantly elusively rabid attacking me &/with my rights & many more, whether handed or not, that group/course/year/planet or not, etc., just like where they come from, & leave again, just like a Ponzi scheme, just like a war machine (just like a little girl with candy from all I could see) - of perfectly blind blame - perfect city/land for it it seems for now), combined with ongoing, literally 24/7 (extremely inhospitably uninhabitable, with permanently induced sleep deprivation - & life scars, obsessions & sentences - to prove), epic plagues of random (cyber, hate) wrongdoing insanity collectively continuing to harass my every breath eternal, global at all compulsive expense & (emotional, financial) harm on me with anything but support (& everything consistently stolen from, including digitally (since long before I ever owned a computer, & the circumstances of the delays alone are a significant example of such fraud; as it turns out I was "never really there", ever, at least in their grand socio-technical scheme of things, not that they ever paid attention, not unless it involves my personal/private data or selectively excluding my academic history from known existence), but not dignity, although identity since early childhood (even including int sport & awards, ironically first season with significantly inhibiting deep foreign body, & almost also new back injury, for eg.), not unless taking is giving) isn't sadistically random kafkaesque enough, & then there's also the aforementioned adverse circumstances as well, but then that's supposedly everyone's story (like GoT?, for eg, but who's Reek? & if ever a trial could only, "in all probability" possibly be won by combat, & with a duel already challenged & declined at the same time rendering me the unwitting instant winner it seems naturally determined long already - how convenient for me when it's all about who over what), or everyone else's!? Does that then make them (Oxford-worthy) pretentious (by Oxford-real random pretense) or (somehow self-pretextually!?) invalid instead?
